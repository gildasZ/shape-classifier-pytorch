    "### 2.3. Calculating Normalization Statistics for Z-Score Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial step in preparing image data for a neural network is **normalization**. Normalization rescales the pixel values to a standard range, which helps the model's optimizer converge faster and more reliably. Without it, the large range of pixel values (0-255) can lead to unstable gradients during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a simple approach is to scale values to a fixed range like `[-1, 1]`, a more robust and widely-used technique is **Z-score standardization**. This method transforms the data so that it has a **mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for each pixel is:\n",
    "$$ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $x$ is the original pixel value\n",
    "- $\\mu$ (mu) is the mean of all pixel values in the dataset\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ (sigma) is the standard deviation of all pixel values\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we must first calculate the true $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ from our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>> Important:** We only ever calculate these statistics on the **training set**. The validation and test sets must remain \"unseen.\" Using statistics from them would be a form of data leakage, giving our model an unfair preview of the data it will be evaluated on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we create a temporary dataset with a simple `ToTensor()` transform to iterate through all training images and compute these two values."

    "### 2.4. Defining the Final Image Transformation Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the exact mean and standard deviation of our training data, we can build our final transformation pipelines. We use `torchvision.transforms.Compose` to chain together multiple operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pipeline will consist of two steps:\n",
    "1.  `transforms.ToTensor()`: This is a critical first step. It converts the PIL Image, which is a grid of pixels with values from `[0, 255]`, into a PyTorch FloatTensor. It also automatically scales the pixel values to a range of `[0.0, 1.0]`.\n",
    "2.  `transforms.Normalize(mean, std)`: This takes the `[0.0, 1.0]` tensor from the previous step and applies the Z-score formula ($z = (x - \\mu) / \\sigma$), using the `mean` and `std` we just calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create two separate pipelines. Although they are identical in this case, it is good practice to distinguish between them. In more complex projects, the training pipeline might include additional data augmentation steps (like random rotations or flips) that should not be applied to the validation or test data."

    "\n",
    "CNNs are the industry standard for computer vision tasks for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Spatial Hierarchy of Features:** Unlike a simple fully-connected network that treats an image as a flat vector of pixels, a CNN processes it as a 2D grid. Its core components, convolutional layers, are designed to learn a hierarchy of features.\n",
    "    -   **Early layers** automatically learn to detect simple patterns like edges, corners, and gradients.\n",
    "    -   **Deeper layers** combine these simple patterns to recognize more complex features, such as the curve of a circle or the right-angle corners of a square.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Parameter Sharing:** A single convolutional filter (e.g., an edge detector) is slid across the entire image. This means the model learns one set of weights for that filter and re-uses it everywhere. This is incredibly efficient compared to a fully-connected layer, which would need a separate weight for every single pixel, leading to an explosion in parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Translation Invariance:** Because the same filter is applied across the whole image, a CNN can detect a feature (like a triangle corner) regardless of where it appears in the image. This is a direct result of parameter sharing and is crucial for our task, as our shapes are randomly placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, a relatively simple CNN with a few convolutional layers followed by a classifier head is sufficient. It is powerful enough to learn the distinguishing features of our shapes without being so complex that it overfits our synthetic dataset. We do not need a large, pre-trained model like ResNet or a Vision Transformer, as that would be overkill for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we define and explore three different neural network architectures for our image classification task. This allows us to compare their performance and understand their unique strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a **Simple CNN** as our baseline, then implement a **ResNet-style model** to see the effect of deeper architectures, and finally explore a **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, which represents the state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1. Model 1: Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why a CNN?** CNNs are the industry standard for computer vision tasks for several key reasons:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2. Model 2: Residual Network (ResNet)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ResNet?** As neural networks get deeper, they can suffer from the \"vanishing gradient\" problem, making them hard to train. ResNet, introduced in 2015, solved this with a simple but revolutionary idea: **residual or \"skip\" connections**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A skip connection allows the input of a block of layers to be added to its output. This creates a \"shortcut\" for the gradient to flow through, enabling the training of much deeper and more powerful networks. For our task, even a simple ResNet-style block can improve performance by allowing for richer feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3. Model 3: Vision Transformer (ViT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ViT?** The Vision Transformer, introduced in 2020, completely changed the computer vision landscape. It adapts the Transformer architecture, originally designed for text processing, to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How it Works:** A ViT splits an image into a sequence of smaller, fixed-size patches (like words in a sentence). It then uses the Transformer's **self-attention mechanism** to learn the relationships between these patches.\n",
    "-   **Strengths:** Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of every other patch when processing a given patch, enabling it to learn complex, long-range spatial relationships.\n",
    "-   **Weaknesses:** ViTs typically require very large datasets to outperform CNNs, but exploring a \"micro-ViT\" on our small dataset is a valuable learning exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.4. Other Potential Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that before deep learning dominated, this problem could have been approached with traditional machine learning models. This would involve a two-step process:\n",
    "1.  **Feature Extraction:** Manually engineering features from the images using algorithms like HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) or SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Classification:** Feeding these features into a classic classifier like a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or a Random Forest.\n",
    "While effective, this approach is less powerful as it relies on hand-crafted features, whereas a deep learning model learns the optimal features automatically."

    "### 4.1. Training Settings: Loss, Optimizer, and Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss Function\n",
    "The **loss function** quantifies how \"wrong\" our model's predictions are compared to the true labels. For a multi-class classification problem like ours, the industry-standard choice is **Cross-Entropy Loss**.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` is particularly powerful because it internally combines two operations:\n",
    "1.  `LogSoftmax`: It converts the model's raw output scores (logits) into a probability distribution.\n",
    "2.  `NLLLoss` (Negative Log Likelihood Loss): It then calculates the loss based on these probabilities.\n",
    "This combined approach is numerically more stable and efficient than applying the two layers separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimizer\n",
    "The **optimizer** is the algorithm that updates the model's weights (parameters) to minimize the loss. We will use the **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)** optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam is a highly effective and popular choice because:\n",
    "-   It is an **adaptive learning rate** method, meaning it maintains a separate learning rate for each parameter and adjusts it as training progresses, often leading to faster convergence than standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n",
    "-   It combines the advantages of two other popular optimizers (AdaGrad and RMSProp), making it robust and generally requiring less manual tuning of the initial learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Rate Scheduler\n",
    "A **learning rate scheduler** dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training. A common strategy is to start with a relatively high learning rate to converge quickly and then decrease it to take smaller, more precise steps as the model gets closer to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `ReduceLROnPlateau`. This scheduler monitors a chosen metric (in our case, the **validation loss**). If the validation loss stops improving for a set number of epochs (a \"patience\" period), the scheduler will reduce the learning rate by a specified factor. This is an intelligent, reactive strategy that adapts to the model's actual performance."

    "### 4.2. The Main Training Loop Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most critical function in our notebook. The `train_model` function encapsulates the entire process of training a model for a set number of epochs. It is designed to be generic, accepting any of our defined model architectures as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust training loop involves several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Epoch Iteration:** A main loop that iterates over the specified number of epochs.\n",
    "2.  **Training & Validation Phases:** Within each epoch, the model goes through two distinct phases:\n",
    "    -   **The `training` phase (`model.train()`):** The model processes the training data, calculates the loss, and uses backpropagation to update its weights. Layers like Dropout and BatchNorm are active in this mode.\n",
    "    -   **The `validation` phase (`model.eval()`):** The model processes the unseen validation data to evaluate its performance. No weight updates occur. Layers like Dropout and BatchNorm are disabled to ensure deterministic output for evaluation.\n",
    "3.  **Metric Tracking:** We carefully track and store the loss and accuracy for both training and validation at each epoch. This history is crucial for later analysis and plotting.\n",
    "4.  **Model Checkpointing:** We don't want to just keep the model from the final epoch; we want the model from the *best* epoch. The loop monitors the validation loss and saves the model's weights (`state_dict`) only when it achieves a new best performance.\n",
    "5.  **Early Stopping:** To save time and prevent overfitting, we implement an \"early stopping\" mechanism. If the validation loss does not improve for a set number of consecutive epochs (our \"patience\"), we halt the training process, assuming the model has converged.\n",
    "6.  **Return Values:** After training is complete (either by reaching the max epochs or by early stopping), the function loads the best saved weights back into the model and returns both the best model and its performance history."

# --- USAGE EXAMPLES ---
: <<'END_OF_EXAMPLES'

# Option: Commit with a message and push to the default branch ('main').
# This is the most basic usage of the script.
./git_update.sh -m "Add documentation for the new API endpoint"

# ---

# Option: Commit and push to a specific branch.
# Useful for working on feature or hotfix branches.
./git_update.sh -m "Implement new user profile page" -b feature/user-profile

# ---

# Option: Commit locally but do NOT push to the remote server.
# Ideal for saving work-in-progress that isn't ready to be shared.
./git_update.sh -m "WIP: Still refactoring the settings module" --no-push

# ---

# Option: Have the script ask for confirmation before acting.
# A safety measure to prevent accidental commits or pushes.
./git_update.sh -m "Final changes before v2.0 release" --ask

# ---

# Option: Combine multiple arguments.
# Example: Commit to a specific 'hotfix' branch, but ask for confirmation first.
./git_update.sh -m "CRITICAL: Fix login security vulnerability" -b hotfix/login-exploit --ask

# ---

# Option: Combine arguments in a different order.
# The order of optional flags does not matter.
./git_update.sh -m "Update styling on homepage" --ask -b main
